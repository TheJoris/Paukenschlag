\section{Conclusions}

Here we present an overview of the results which can be found in this thesis.

\subsection{Brownian Dynamics}
We succeeded in altering the Brownian dynamics algorithm by Morelli, such that it can be used for simulating diffusing and reactions in 2D and interactions with structures. By introducing the reaction volume, we have split-up the single step reaction of the algorithm by Morelli in to two steps. Now, in order to calculate the acceptance probability, we only need to calculate this volume, instead of the much more difficult 'volume' of the old method. This enables us to simulate diffusion and reactions in all dimensions and interaction with structures, as is required for \GFRD. The algorithm is still very simple because a reaction only depends on the distance between objects and the easy to calculate acceptance probability. 
Because we enforced the detailed balance relation between the association and the dissociation of a complex of two particles, the algorithm perfectly simulates the equilibrium properties of the reaction network. And, as we have shown, for small enough timesteps, also simulates the particle dynamics reasonable well. 

\subsection{The promoter site in eGFRD}
It is now possible to simulate promoter sites using Green's Function Reaction Dynamics. The promoter is represented as a point-sink on a rod, where a particle can bind with when it diffuses allong this rod and glides over it. To be able to simulate this promoter using \GFRD, we derived a Green's function for a 1D domain with two absorbing boundaries, a sink and the uit instantanious source for the particle starting position. We used the promoter in \GFRD\, to look at the temperal noise in the promoter occupancy and compare it with our analytical result. 

\subsection{Deriving the fundamental noise limit in transcription regulation}
We derived the fundamental lower bound on the noise in transcriptional regulation. In the limit of low concentrations, we were able to exactly solve our model of transcription factors ariving and leaving the promoter site without using any linearization. Comparing the analytical result with novel simulations done with \GFRD, shows that we can correctly predict the temperal noise in the promoter occupancy for the whole range of the average occupancy of the promoter. From our analytical result, we predict how wel a promoter can infer the transcription factor concentration in the cytoplasm from the promoter state while measuring a time $T$. It turns out this noise is inversely proportional to the number of independent particles which bind to the promoter during the integration time $T$ times the fraction of time the promoter is unoccupied. 

Next, we compared our expression for the noise in a promoter with an expression derived by Tka$\check{\rm c}$ik who used a very different method. The important difference is that the noise in Tka$\check{\rm c}$ik's expression is independent of the promoter occupancy, which is likely the result of the linearizations done in his method. Furthermore, we show that we get better quantative agreement with simumalions if we represent the DNA as a cylinder instead of a line. 

Finally, we show that the method by de Ronde to derive the correlation time by using a correlation function for the promoter state is, in the limit of low concentrations, equivalent to the method by van Zon who renormalizes the reaction rates by the average number of rebindings.



\section{Possibilities for future research}
Although we put a lot of effort in enabeling \GFRD\, to simulate promoter sites, we only used it in a simple configuration of a single promoter site reacting with one particle species. It would be intersesting to expand this scheme such that the binding of a transcription factor to the promoter enables the expression of a protein. We can measure the fluctuations in the protein concentration, and compare results with simulations done earlier by van Zon \cite{VanZon2006}, where the promoter was represented as a spherical particle in the cytoplasm. 

Even more intesting would be, if the protein expression would be regulated by multiple promoter sites positioned in close proximity on the DNA. For instance, two promoter sites can enhance the expression of a single protein when both of the sites are occupied by a transcription factor. This way a cell can regulate its protein levels using logic operations. These systems are oftenly analysed using mean-field theory where the particles are asumed to be uniformly distributed in space. Because transcription factors are present in low concentrations in the cell, and because of their 1D sliding allong the DNA between the promoter sites, we expect that the spatio-temporal correlations have a profound effect on the operation of these logic gates. We base or expectation on the result found in \cite{Takahashi2010}, where they studies the effects of spatio-temporal correlations on the functioning of the MAPK pathway.
