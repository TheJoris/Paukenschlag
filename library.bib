abstract = {Several stochastic simulation algorithms (SSAs) have recently been proposed for modelling reaction-diffusion processes in cellular and molecular biology. In this paper, two commonly used SSAs are studied. The first SSA is an on-lattice model described by the reaction-diffusion master equation. The second SSA is an off-lattice model based on the simulation of Brownian motion of individual molecules and their reactive collisions. In both cases, it is shown that the commonly used implementation of bimolecular reactions (i.e. the reactions of the form A + B --> C or A + A --> C) might lead to incorrect results. Improvements of both SSAs are suggested which overcome the difficulties highlighted. In particular, a formula is presented for the smallest possible compartment size (lattice spacing) which can be correctly implemented in the first model. This implementation uses a new formula for the rate of bimolecular reactions per compartment (lattice site).},

@article{Benichou2008,
abstract = {Various examples of biochemical reactions in cells, such as DNA/protein interactions, reveal that in extremely diluted regimes reaction paths are not always simple brownian trajectories. They can rather be qualified as intermittent, since they combine slow diffusion phases on one hand and a second mode of faster transport on the other hand, which can be either a faster diffusion mode, as in the case of DNA-binding proteins, or a ballistic mode powered by molecular motors in the case of intracellular transport. In this article, we introduce simple theoretical models which permit to calculate explicitly the reaction rates for reactions limited by intermittent transport. This approach shows quantitatively that intermittent reaction pathways are actually very efficient, since they permit to significantly increase the reaction rates, which could explain why they are observed so often. Moreover, we give theoretical arguments which suggest that intermittent transport could also be useful for in vitro chemistry. Indeed, we show that intermittent transport naturally pops up in the context of reaction at interfaces, where reactants combine surface diffusion phases and bulk excursions, and could permit to enhance reactivity. In this case, adjusting chemically the affinity of reactants with the interface makes possible to optimize the reaction rate.},

abstract = {Transcription factors regulate gene expression through their binding to DNA. In a living Escherichia coli cell, we directly observed specific binding of a lac repressor, labeled with a fluorescent protein, to a chromosomal lac operator. Using single-molecule detection techniques, we measured the kinetics of binding and dissociation of the repressor in response to metabolic signals. Furthermore, we characterized the nonspecific binding to DNA, one-dimensional (1D) diffusion along DNA segments, and 3D translocation among segments through cytoplasm at the single-molecule level. In searching for the operator, a lac repressor spends approximately 90\% of time nonspecifically bound to and diffusing along DNA with a residence time of <5 milliseconds. The methods and findings can be generalized to other nucleic acid binding proteins.},

abstract = {The restriction endonuclease EcoRV can rapidly locate a short recognition site within long non-cognate DNA using 'facilitated diffusion'. This process has long been attributed to a sliding mechanism, in which the enzyme first binds to the DNA via nonspecific interaction and then moves along the DNA by 1D diffusion. Recent studies, however, provided evidence that 3D translocations (hopping/jumping) also help EcoRV to locate its target site. Here we report the first direct observation of sliding and jumping of individual EcoRV molecules along nonspecific DNA. Using fluorescence microscopy, we could distinguish between a slow 1D diffusion of the enzyme and a fast translocation mechanism that was demonstrated to stem from 3D jumps. Salt effects on both sliding and jumping were investigated, and we developed numerical simulations to account for both the jump frequency and the jump length distribution. We deduced from our study the 1D diffusion coefficient of EcoRV, and we estimated the number of jumps occurring during an interaction event with nonspecific DNA. Our results substantiate that sliding alternates with hopping/jumping during the facilitated diffusion of EcoRV and, furthermore, set up a framework for the investigation of target site location by other DNA-binding proteins.},

abstract = {Gene expression levels fluctuate even under constant external conditions. Much emphasis has usually been placed on the components of this noise that are due to randomness in transcription and translation. Here we focus on the role of noise associated with the inputs to transcriptional regulation; in particular, we analyze the effects of random arrival times and binding of transcription factors to their target sites along the genome. This contribution to the total noise sets a fundamental physical limit to the reliability of genetic control, and has clear signatures, but we show that these are easily obscured by experimental limitations and even by conventional methods for plotting the variance vs. mean expression level. We argue that simple, universal models of noise dominated by transcription and translation are inconsistent with the embedding of gene expression in a network of regulatory interactions. Analysis of recent experiments on transcriptional control in the early Drosophila embryo shows that these results are quantitatively consistent with the predicted signatures of input noise, and we discuss the experiments needed to test the importance of input noise more generally.},

abstract = {Statistical fluctuations limit the precision with which a microorganism can, in a given time T, determine the concentration of a chemoattractant in the surrounding medium. The best a cell can do is to monitor continually the state of occupation of receptors distributed over its surface. For nearly optimum performance only a small fraction of the surface need be specifically adsorbing. The probability that a molecule that has collided with the cell will find a receptor is Ns/(Ns + pi a), if N receptors, each with a binding site of radius s, are evenly distributed over a cell of radius a. There is ample room for many indenpendent systems of specific receptors. The adsorption rate for molecules of moderate size cannot be significantly enhanced by motion of the cell or by stirring of the medium by the cell. The least fractional error attainable in the determination of a concentration c is approximately (TcaD) - 1/2, where D is diffusion constant of the attractant. The number of specific receptors needed to attain such precision is about a/s. Data on bacteriophage absorption, bacterial chemotaxis, and chemotaxis in a cellular slime mold are evaluated. The chemotactic sensitivity of Escherichia coli approaches that of the cell of optimum design.},

abstract = {Long ago inferred by biochemists, the linear diffusion of proteins along DNA has recently been observed at a single-molecule level using fluorescence microscopy. This imaging technique requires labeling the protein of interest with a fluorophore, usually an organic nanosized dye that is not supposed to impact the dynamics of the protein. Yet individual proteins can also be tracked using much larger labels, like quantum dots or beads. We investigate here the impact of such a large label on the protein diffusion along DNA. Solving a Fokker-Planck equation, we estimate the diffusion constant of a protein-label complex diffusing in a periodic potential that mimics the DNA-protein interaction, the link between the protein and the label being modeled as a Hookean spring. Our results indicate that the diffusion constant can generally be calculated by considering that the motion of the protein in the DNA potential is decoupled from the Brownian motion of the label. Our conclusions are in good agreement with the experimental results we obtained with the restriction enzyme EcoRV, assuming a rotation-coupled diffusion of the enzyme along DNA.},

abstract = {In the simplest view of transcriptional regulation, the expression of a gene is turned on or off by changes in the concentration of a transcription factor (TF). We use recent data on noise levels in gene expression to show that it should be possible to transmit much more than just one regulatory bit. Realizing this optimal information capacity would require that the dynamic range of TF concentrations used by the cell, the input/output relation of the regulatory module, and the noise in gene expression satisfy certain matching relations, which we derive. These results provide parameter-free, quantitative predictions connecting independently measurable quantities. Although we have considered only the simplified problem of a single gene responding to a single TF, we find that these predictions are in surprisingly good agreement with recent experiments on the Bicoid/Hunchback system in the early Drosophila embryo and that this system achieves approximately 90\% of its theoretical maximum information transmission.},

abstract = {Brownian Dynamics algorithms have been widely used for simulating systems in soft-condensed matter physics. In recent times, their application has been extended to the simulation of coarse-grained models of biochemical networks. In these models, components move by diffusion and interact with one another upon contact. However, when reactions are incorporated into a Brownian dynamics algorithm, care must be taken to avoid violations of the detailed-balance rule, which would introduce systematic errors in the simulation. We present a Brownian dynamics algorithm for simulating reaction-diffusion systems that rigorously obeys detailed balance for equilibrium reactions. By comparing the simulation results to exact analytical results for a bimolecular reaction, we show that the algorithm correctly reproduces both equilibrium and dynamical quantities. We apply our scheme to a "push-pull" network in which two antagonistic enzymes covalently modify a substrate. Our results highlight that spatial fluctuations of the network components can strongly reduce the gain of the response of a biochemical network.},

abstract = {We have developed a new numerical technique, called Green's-function reaction dynamics (GFRD), that makes it possible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level and in both time and space. In this scheme, a maximum time step is chosen such that only single particles or pairs of particles have to be considered. For these particles, the Smoluchowski equation can be solved analytically using Green's functions. The main idea of GFRD is to exploit the exact solution of the Smoluchoswki equation to set up an event-driven algorithm, which combines in one step the propagation of the particles in space with the reactions between them. The event-driven nature allows GFRD to make large jumps in time and space when the particles are far apart from each other. Here, we apply the technique to a simple model of gene expression. The simulations reveal that spatial fluctuations can be a major source of noise in biochemical networks. The calculations also show that GFRD is highly efficient. Under biologically relevant conditions, GFRD is up to five orders of magnitude faster than conventional particle-based techniques for simulating biochemical networks in time and space. GFRD is not limited to biochemical networks. It can also be applied to a large number of other reaction-diffusion problems.},

abstract = {Methods are presented for simulating chemical reaction networks with a spatial resolution that is accurate to nearly the size scale of individual molecules. Using an intuitive picture of chemical reaction systems, each molecule is treated as a point-like particle that diffuses freely in three-dimensional space. When a pair of reactive molecules collide, such as an enzyme and its substrate, a reaction occurs and the simulated reactants are replaced by products. Achieving accurate bimolecular reaction kinetics is surprisingly difficult, requiring a careful consideration of reaction processes that are often overlooked. This includes whether the rate of a reaction is at steady-state and the probability that multiple reaction products collide with each other to yield a back reaction. Inputs to the simulation are experimental reaction rates, diffusion coefficients and the simulation time step. From these are calculated the simulation parameters, including the 'binding radius' and the 'unbinding radius', where the former defines the separation for a molecular collision and the latter is the initial separation between a pair of reaction products. Analytic solutions are presented for some simulation parameters while others are calculated using look-up tables. Capabilities of these methods are demonstrated with simulations of a simple bimolecular reaction and the Lotka-Volterra system.},

abstract = {Multisite covalent modification of proteins is omnipresent in eukaryotic cells. A well-known example is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade where, in each layer of the cascade, a protein is phosphorylated at two sites. It has long been known that the response of a MAPK pathway strongly depends on whether the enzymes that modify the protein act processively or distributively. A distributive mechanism, in which the enzyme molecules have to release the substrate molecules in between the modification of the two sites, can generate an ultrasensitive response and lead to hysteresis and bistability. We study by Green's Function Reaction Dynamics (GFRD), a stochastic scheme that makes it possible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level in time and space, a dual phosphorylation cycle in which the enzymes act according to a distributive mechanism. We find that the response of this network can differ dramatically from that predicted by a mean-field analysis based on the chemical rate equations. In particular, rapid rebindings of the enzyme molecules to the substrate molecules after modification of the first site can markedly speed up the response and lead to loss of ultrasensitivity and bistability. In essence, rapid enzyme-substrate rebindings can turn a distributive mechanism into a processive mechanism. We argue that slow ADP release by the enzymes can protect the system against these rapid rebindings, thus enabling ultrasensitivity and bistability.},

abstract = {We study by Green's Function Reaction Dynamics the effect of the diffusive motion of repressor molecules on the noise in mRNA and protein levels for a gene that is under the control of a repressor. We find that spatial fluctuations due to diffusion can drastically enhance the noise in gene expression. After dissociation from the operator, a repressor can rapidly rebind to the DNA. Our results show that the rebinding trajectories are so short that, on this timescale, the RNA polymerase (RNAP) cannot effectively compete with the repressor for binding to the promoter. As a result, a dissociated repressor molecule will on average rebind many times, before it eventually diffuses away. These rebindings thus lower the effective dissociation rate, and this increases the noise in gene expression. Another consequence of the timescale separation between repressor rebinding and RNAP association is that the effect of spatial fluctuations can be described by a well-stirred, zero-dimensional, model by renormalizing the reaction rates for repressor-DNA (un) binding. Our results thus support the use of well-stirred, zero-dimensional models for describing noise in gene expression. We also show that for a fixed repressor strength, the noise due to diffusion can be minimized by increasing the number of repressors or by decreasing the rate of the open complex formation. Lastly, our results emphasize that power spectra are a highly useful tool for studying the propagation of noise through the different stages of gene expression.},

[Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T (2005) Science 308:414-415] showed that the three cyanobacterial clock proteins KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC are sufficient in vitro to generate circadian phosphorylation of KaiC. Here, we present a mathematical model of the Kai system. At its heart is the assumption that KaiC can exist in two conformational states, one favoring phosphorylation and the other dephosphorylation. Each individual KaiC hexamer then has a propensity to be phosphorylated in a cyclic manner. To generate macroscopic oscillations, however, the phosphorylation cycles of the different hexamers must be synchronized. We propose a novel synchronization mechanism based on differential affinity: KaiA stimulates KaiC phosphorylation, but the limited supply of KaiA dimers binds preferentially to those KaiC hexamers that are falling behind in the oscillation. KaiB sequesters KaiA and stabilizes the dephosphorylating KaiC state. We show that our model can reproduce a wide range of published data, including the observed insensitivity of the oscillation period to variations in temperature, and that it makes nontrivial predictions about the effects of varying the concentrations of the Kai proteins.},
