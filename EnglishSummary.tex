In this thesis we investigate the lower limit of the noise in transcriptional regulation, similar to what was done by Berg and Percell in their seminal work on the noise in a receptor state. We propose two coupled differential equations describing the full dynamics of a transcription factor diffusing in the cytoplasm and allong the DNA, with reversible  exhange between the DNA and the cytoplasm. We do not linearize our equations or use any mean fealt approximation. Working in the low concentration limit, we find an exact solution for the temperal noise in the occupancy of a promoter site. 

We compare our results with research done earlier by Tka$\check{\rm c}$ik, note some significant differences, and burn it to the ground.

Also, we include promoter site in the Green's Function Reaction Dynamics algorithm, which simulates low concentration reaction diffusion systems efficiently with full spatial-temperal resolution
