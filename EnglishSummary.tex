The diffusive arrival of transcription factors to the promoter site sets a upper bound on the precision by whichs cells can regulate their proteine levels. In this thesis we investigate this lower limit, similar to what was done by Berg and Percell in their seminal work on the noise in the receptor state. We propose two coupled differential equations describing the full dynamics of a transcription factor diffusing in the cytoplasm and allong the DNA, with reversible exhange between the DNA and the cytoplasm. We do not linearize our equations or use any mean fealt approximation. Working in the low concentration limit, we find an exact solution for the temperal noise in the occupancy of a promoter site.

This result shows to minima in the noise, caused by a competition between the average promoter occupancy, the arrival rate of transcription factors to the promoter site and enhanced temperal correlations due to 1D diffusion around the promoter. 

Furthermore, we compare our results with research done earlier by Tka$\check{\rm c}$ik, and note some significant differences.

We expanded the Green's Function Reaction Dynamics algorithm, such that we can simulate the proces of transcriptional regulation. Our analytical results correctly predicts the temperal noise in the promoter occupancy in our simulations.
