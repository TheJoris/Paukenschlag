The precision by which a cell can regulate its protein levels is greatly limited by the diffusive arrival of transcription factors to their promoter. In this thesis we derive an analytical expression for this limit, and expand the Green's Function Reaction Dynamics algorithm (GFRD) used for simulating reaction-diffusion systems, to verify our results.

We propose two coupled differential equations describing the full dynamics of a transcription factor diffusing in the cytoplasm and allong the DNA, with reversible exhange between the DNA and the cytoplasm. We do not linearize our equations or use any mean fealt approximation. Working in the low concentration limit, we find an exact solution for the temperal noise in the occupancy of a promoter site. 

Furthermore, we compare our results with results found earlier by Tka$\check{\rm c}$ik. The primary difference is that his expression for the noise is independent of the occupancy of the promoter, which is likely due to linearizations needed in his method.

Before we can simulate a promoter, we have to modify the original Brownian dynamics algorithm by Morelli used in GFRD. 





To simulate a promoter in GFRD, we derive a Green's function on a 1D domain with two absorbing boundaries and a unit instantanious source at the starting position of the particle. The promoter is represented with a sink, generating an outflux proportional to the intrinsic rate and the probability of being at the sink. 

Furthermore, we modified an existing Brownian dynamics algorithm by Morelli,

Our analytical result correctly predicts the temperal noise in the promoter occupancy found in our simulations.

The result shows a minimum in the noise set by the time a transcription factor spends on the DNA.

similar to what was done by Berg and Percell in their seminal work on the noise in the receptor state. 


The noise introduced by the diffusive arrival of transcription factors at the promoter site, sets a lower limit to the noise in the protein levels.
