In this thesis we investigate the lower limit of the noise in transcriptional regulation, similar to what was done by Berg and Percell in their seminal work on the noise in the receptor state. We propose two coupled differential equations describing the full dynamics of a transcription factor diffusing in the cytoplasm and allong the DNA, with reversible exhange between the DNA and the cytoplasm. We do not linearize our equations or use any mean fealt approximation. Working in the low concentration limit, we find an exact solution for the temperal noise in the occupancy of a promoter site.

, and in the transcription factor concentration inferred from the occupancy. 

We find that 

We compare our results with research done earlier by Tka$\check{\rm c}$ik, note some significant differences, and burn it to the ground.

Also, we expanded the Green's Function Reaction Dynamics algorithm, such that we can simulate proces of transcriptional regulation.


which simulates low concentration reaction diffusion systems efficiently with full spatial-temperal resolution.
