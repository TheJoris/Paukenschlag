\subsection{Noise in transcriptional regulation}

The expression of a gene is enhanced or repressed when a transcription factor (TF) binds to a promoter site on the DNA. Because TF's are present in the cell at very low concentrations (~10) and due to their diffusive arrival at the promoter site, the time a promoter is occupied by a TF can vary widely in time.
